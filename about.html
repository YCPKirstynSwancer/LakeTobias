      From our establishment in 1965, Lake Tobias Wildlife Park has been focused on providing fun family activities and animal-themed attractions for local residents and central Pennsylvania visitors to enjoy.

    <div class="about_intro_content">
      <h2>Our Founder</h2>
      <p>Lake Tobias Wildlife Park was founded by J.R. Tobias as “just a hobby to fall back on in my retirement” and grew into a beloved local attraction over the decades. Originally, J.R.’s interest in wildlife and exotic creatures led him to consider agriculture and animals as a career, but he opted to join the Marines instead of going to college, enlisting in 1943. After leaving the Marines, J.R. Tobias went on to own multiple successful businesses, including a dairy, a cement block manufacturing company, a John Deere farm machinery business, and an excavating and grading company. The equipment and skills from these businesses came in handy when it was time to build the park. He constructed all of the stream-fed lakes that visitors enjoy today during visits to Lake Tobias Wildlife Park.</br>
      Before J.R. Tobias’ death, he transferred ownership and operation of the park to his children, and his six remaining children and a grandchild run the park today. This self-sustaining family attraction welcomes over 180,000 visitors a year. The park gets no state or federal funding, so revenue from the park covers all operating expenses.</p>

<section class="Giraffe_Section">

<h1>Giraffes</h1>
</div>
<div class="About_Body">
  <p>Come meet our newest additions to the park – our three Reticulated Giraffes, Spike, Bakari, and Tucker. Take the trail through the newest section of the park to arrive at their new exhibit located adjacent to the safari tour. You’ll find them roaming in their pasture where they have over three acres of land to explore and play, or interact with park visitors. Giraffes are the tallest land animal on earth and getting to see these gravity-defying creatures up close is a unique experience that is not to be forgotten.</br>
  <h2>Close Encounter</h2>
  Spike, Bakari, and Tucker also have their own elevated feeding platform. As a visitor you will be able to purchase special food for the giraffes and get up close and personal as they take the food right out of your hands.</br>
  Please note that the giraffes’ diet is very strict, even more so than other animals at the park. A limited supply of food will be sold during each feeding time so that our giraffes maintain a healthy weight. Food selection may vary by day and there may be periods of time when they are not taking snacks from visitors.</br>
