        			<h1>About Our Family Activities In Central Pennsylvania</h1>
          <div>
            <p>From our establishment in 1965, Lake Tobias Wildlife Park has been focused on providing fun family activities and animal-themed attractions for local residents and central Pennsylvania visitors to enjoy.</p>
  					<h2>Our Founder</h2>
  					<p>Lake Tobias Wildlife Park was founded by J.R. Tobias as “just a hobby to fall back on in my retirement” and grew into a beloved local attraction over the decades. Originally, J.R.’s interest in wildlife and exotic creatures led him to consider agriculture and animals as a career, but he opted to join the Marines instead of going to college, enlisting in 1943. After leaving the Marines, J.R. Tobias went on to own multiple successful businesses, including a dairy, a cement block manufacturing company, a John Deere farm machinery business, and an excavating and grading company. The equipment and skills from these businesses came in handy when it was time to build the park. He constructed all of the stream-fed lakes that visitors enjoy today during visits to Lake Tobias Wildlife Park.<br>
  					Before J.R. Tobias’ death, he transferred ownership and operation of the park to his children, and his six remaining children and a grandchild run the park today. This self-sustaining family attraction welcomes over 180,000 visitors a year. The park gets no state or federal funding, so revenue from the park covers all operating expenses.</p>

          <br/>
          <p>Come meet our newest additions to the park – our three Reticulated Giraffes, Spike, Bakari, and Tucker. Take the trail through the newest section of the park to arrive at their new exhibit located adjacent to the safari tour. You’ll find them roaming in their pasture where they have over three acres of land to explore and play, or interact with park visitors. Giraffes are the tallest land animal on earth and getting to see these gravity-defying creatures up close is a unique experience that is not to be forgotten.</p>
          <h2>Close Encounter</h2>
          <p>Spike, Bakari, and Tucker also have their own elevated feeding platform. As a visitor you will be able to purchase special food for the giraffes and get up close and personal as they take the food right out of your hands.<br>
          Please note that the giraffes’ diet is very strict, even more so than other animals at the park. A limited supply of food will be sold during each feeding time so that our giraffes maintain a healthy weight. Food selection may vary by day and there may be periods of time when they are not taking snacks from visitors.<br>
          </p>
      </div>

      </div>

      <div class="right_maincontent">
				<p>In 2015 we opened a new Safari Station to improve our guests’ safari experience. The new station features a larger loading area to accommodate more guests, as well as a snack shop and restrooms.<br/>
				On our busiest days, we run ten tour buses on a continuous basis, allowing us to send out a new tour every 10-15 minutes.
				<p/>

        <h2>Petting Zoo</h2>
        <p>All parents want to create meaningful memories with their kids. For an experience your children will remember for years to come, visit the Petting Zoo at Lake Tobias Wildlife Park.<br/>
				Children and adults alike will enjoy our collection of friendly creatures from all over the world. We have animals of all shapes and sizes, from the smallest African pygmy goats to long-necked alpacas. Visit everything from domestic farm animals and exotics like camels and alpacas. We take special care of our creatures, so they are happy and well-socialized. Our animals love attention, but keep in mind that they are not trained, so they may jump on you or nibble on your clothes. Also, note that some animals live in the petting zoo area but are not available for petting.</p>
        <h2>Pet and Feed</h2>
        <p>Like most attractions at Lake Tobias, visitors are welcome to feed the animals in the Petting Zoo.<br/>
				Pellets and carrots can be purchased from employees at the petting zoo booth or from coin-operated dispensers located around the petting zoo and the rest of the park. The USDA carefully regulates these animals’ diets, so please keep in mind that only food sold at the park may be given to any of our zoo creatures. This is to protect them from accidentally being exposed to any outside contaminants.

        <h2>Lions, Tigers and Bears</h2>
        <p>Many Lake Tobias visitors absolutely shudder with the anticipation of meeting the most fearsome species we display, including the magnificent African lion, one of the most distinctly recognizable predators on the planet. Not far behind is the Bengal tiger – with its unmistakable stripes and immense size, this creature has earned a formidable reputation, and Lake Tobias Wildlife Park offers a chance to see both of these big cats up close and personal.<br/>
				The black bear is another favorite with its fair share of admirers. Spread far and wide across North America, these omnivorous creatures may not be as large as other species, but they can nonetheless reach an impressive stature. Often weighing over 500 lb. and sometimes measuring up to 6’ tall, they’re certainly a sight to behold.<br/>
        </p>
				<h2>Birds Everywhere</h2>
				<p>View some of the world’s most distinctive feathered fauna at Lake Tobias Wildlife Park. Drink in the sight of our ostriches, a bird that is both flightless and astonishingly large. Among our more elegant tenants is the East African crowned crane, which features an immediately identifiable golden crest that radiates royalty. While navigating the park, visitors may even catch this bird performing an energetic dance that is part of the species’ mating ritual. Equally elegant and famed for its stunning plumage, the peacock has long remained a staple of zoos across the globe, enchanting onlookers with its spread of iridescent feathers. The peacock, along with various chickens and guinea roam the park freely interacting with visitors.
					<p/>
				<h2>Smaller Mammals</h2>
				<p>Lake Tobias is also home to many smaller mammals which have just as much personality as their larger relatives. Children of all ages enjoy the curious prairie dogs which enjoy popping up from their underground homes that they build in their specialized exhibit. You can also check out the largest rodent in the world, the Capybara, who peacefully swim in the lake and cautiously check out park visitors. A new addition, our Gibbons, have quickly become a park favorite due to their distinct singing and expressive faces.<p/>

				<h1 id="SmoothScrollBabyAnimal">Baby Animal Program</h1>
				<br/>
			<p>At Lake Tobias Wildlife Park, we have a Baby Animal Program to help the babies in our care. While you are here, you will be able to meet the youngsters featured in the park exhibits. For more than half a century, we have been nestled in Halifax, PA with baby animals and their families.
			<p/>
			<p>Baby animals are one of the most popular reasons that folks come to the park each year, with the selection changing every season. The Baby Animal Crew helps care for littles who may have been rejected by the mother requiring our staff to step in and take over.  Sometimes, the separation is temporary while the baby is being treated for an illness or needs help with early-detected nursing difficulties.  And, other times it is to get the baby ready to be placed in another zoo. An animal that is hand-raised is much less stressed when transporting, when needing veterinary care and when transitioning to a new home.<br/>
			We allow the baby animals time to socialize with guests while also tending to their food, relaxation and family socialization needs. Most of the little creatures may be touched and Baby Animal Crew members are on hand to answer your questions. You may also find a feeding schedule posted at the exhibit for you to get a glimpse of some of the youngsters while they eat. All baby animals are on a strict, regulated diet to ensure their health, so please do not feed the babies.<p/>

			<h2>Other Baby Animal Sightings</h2>
			<p>In addition to the baby animals being cared for by the Baby Animal Crew, you can see young animals in exhibits with their parents in many cases. As you go through the park, make sure you find out which of our animals have youngsters for you to enjoy.<br/>
			We have animals from six different continents, which means that you and your family will have the opportunity to see exotic creatures from afar as well as offerings from closer to home, such as the North American bison. Whether you want to see the Bengal tigers, two-toed tree sloth or De Brazza monkey exhibit, you are sure to appreciate the animals and their young.<br/>
			If you are planning a trip near Halifax, PA, this summer, make sure to schedule a visit to Lake Tobias Wildlife Park. You can enjoy the baby animals along with the safari tours and reptile shows!
