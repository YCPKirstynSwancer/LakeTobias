<h3>African Lion</h3>
  <img src="img/animalimgs/africanlion.jpg" alt="mammals">
    <p>African lions can be found in prides of 20 or more females and usually one dominant male. However, there can be up to four males in a pride, usually from the same litter, still only having one dominant male.</br>When females give birth of two to four young, mothers will take turns babysitting while the others hunt. Females do the hunting at dusk and will kill enough for the whole pride to eat. Males very seldom help in the hunting process. African lions prefer to eat wildebeest and zebras but will also hunt antelope, rhinos, hippos and young elephants if their preferred food choice is scarce.

<h3>Bengal Tiger</h3>
  <img src="img/animalimgs/bengaltiger.jpg" alt="mammals">
    <p>Bengal tigers are found throughout India, Bangladesh, Burma and Nepal. They are a solitary animal and both males and females have their own marked territory. They mark this territory by spraying urine on trees and rocks as well as scratching bark off of trees. Bengal tigers are known as one of nature’s most feared predators and can kill animals over twice their size. They are considered nocturnal and will hunt only at night.</br>A tiger’s stripes help them to camouflage into their surroundings, and their stripes are unique to each tiger.</br>A mother will give birth to two to four young that will live with their mother up to three years. After they are grown, they move on and establish their own territory.

<h3>American Black Bear</h3>
  <img src="img/animalimgs/blackbear.jpg" alt="Amammals">
    <p>The American black bear is the most common and widely distributed type of bear but are not always black. In fact, black bears can also be brown, blonde or even white.  White black bears are called “Spirit Bears” and are generally rare. They are only found in Central and North British Columbia.</br>Black bears can stand between five to six feet tall and weigh over 500 pounds. They like to eat berries, fruit, fish and small mammals. Black bears will hibernate each winter at which time a mother will give birth to two young. In order to hibernate, especially for pregnant females, it is important to eat more in the months approaching winter. Their bodies will burn their fat resources while they sleep so they will not need to wake up during their hibernation to hunt for food.

<h3>Asian Water Buffalo</h3>
  <img src="img/animalimgs/asianwaterbuffalo.jpg" alt="mammals">
    <p>Asian water buffalo are found in India, Nepal and Thailand. They can grow to over 2000 pounds. Water buffalo are helpful in farming because they are able to work in wet muddy conditions that aren’t ideal for horses or donkeys.</br>Water buffalo are also used for riding, for their meat and for milk. In fact, water buffalo’s milk is used to produce the best mozzarella cheese. They have richer, creamier milk than regular dairy cows do.

<h3>North American Bison</h3>
  <img src="img/animalimgs/northamericanbison.jpg" alt="mammals">
    <p>North American bison come from the Great Plains area of western United States. At one point, millions of bison could be found roaming the Great Plains. Unfortunately, they were hunted nearly to extinction in the 1800s. Then the Federal Government stepped in and declared the bison an endangered species and banned all hunting. Since then, the American bison have repopulated their herds and are no longer endangered.</br>Baby bison are a dark red color until about 6 months old, when they turn dark brown like the adults. Some bison can be white, or a cream color, which is considered sacred by the Native Americans. Adults can weigh over 2000 pounds.

<h3>Watusi</h3>
  <img src="img/animalimgs/Watusi.jpg" alt="mammals">
    <p>Watusi are cattle found in Africa and are also known as Ankole cattle. Although red is the most common color, Watusi can be tan or black in color and can also have white spots. Watusi have large heavy horns, about 19 inches in diameter and up to six feet from tip to tip.</br>Watusi are considered sacred animals to many tribes in Africa and are symbols of power and wealth. The more watusi a chief owns, the richer he is considered to be. For tribal ceremonies, a small cut will be made in the watusi’s neck and a small amount of blood will be drawn. The blood will then be drunk or mixed with milk to produce blood pudding. The intention is not to harm or kill the animal; in fact tribes only kill watusi for important weddings or funerals.

  <h3>European Fallow Deer</h3>
    <img src="img/animalimgs/replacefallow.png" alt="mammals">
    <p>Fallow deer are found in Europe and come in three colors- dark brown, white and spotted. Just because a female fallow deer is one color does not mean her offspring will be the same color as her. In fact, she could give birth to any of the three color phases.</br>Male fallow deer have a palmed antler much like that of a moose. If the antler is nine inches across, it is considered to be a good sized antler. These antlers will fall off each year and regrow again in the spring.</br>Fallow deer live in herds of around 70 members and prefer to live in wooded areas. They eat grass, leaves, nuts, berries, corn and bark.

  <h3>Eland</h3>
    <img src="img/animalimgs/eland.jpg" alt="mammals">
    <p>Elands are the largest antelope in the world and are found throughout South Africa. They weigh between 1000 to 2000 pounds and stand five to six feet tall at the shoulder. Although they are extremely large animals, Elands can still jump almost six feet in the air most times jumping over other members of the herd to avoid predators. Elands have spiraled horns measuring up to four feet long.</br>They prefer to live in herds of 25 to 75 members and eat grass, leaves and fruit. Elands are known for making a “clicking” noise when they walk which is thought to be their split toes hitting together. Africans say they can often hear a heard of elands coming miles away before they ever see them.

  <h3>Dromedary Camel</h3>
  <img src="img/animalimgs/camel.jpg" alt="mammals">
    <p>Dromedary camels have only one hump. Their hump is not used to store water like most people think. Instead, it is used to store fat resources which are used when food and water is scarce. They will eat any vegetation they can find and can drink up to 50 gallons of water at a time.</br> Camels have adapted to living in the desert by growing long eyelashes to protect their eyes from sun and sand. They can also completely close off their nostrils to keep sand out. Camels are used today for work, food, clothing, transportation and sport racing.

  <h3>Two Toed Tree Sloth</h3>
  <img src="img/animalimgs/twotoedtreesloth.jpg" alt="mammals">
    <p>Tree sloths are found in Central and South America. Two-toed sloths have two toes on their front feet and three toes on their back feet. Their close relative, the three-toed sloth has three toes on all four feet.</br>Sloths will spend most of their life hanging upside down in the treetops and seldom move. Because the rainforest is so hot and humid, sloths will begin growing small plants and moss in their hair, giving them a green appearance which helps to camouflage them with their surroundings.</br>Because sloths are made for hanging, they cannot walk. If they are found on the ground, they will drag themselves around on their stomachs. However, sloths are said to be extremely good swimmers. Sloths generally only come down from a tree to defecate and will even give birth while hanging upside down. Sloths eat fruit, leaves and flowers and have the slowest digestive system. It takes them up to 1 month to digest a meal.</br>

  <h3>De Brazza Monkey</h3>
  <img src="img/animalimgs/debrazzamonkey.jpg" alt="mammals">
    <p>DeBrazza monkeys got their name from the French explorer Pierre Savorgnan De Brazza.</br>De Brazza monkeys are also known as swamp monkeys because they live in the wetlands and forests of Africa. They are also very good swimmers and like to live in groups of up to 10 monkeys.</br>They like to eat fruit, flowers, leaves, insects, worms, small lizards and frogs.</br>De Brazza monkeys are known for their ability to “freeze”- becoming motionless when they feel threatened and remain motionless up to 8 hours. Natural predators of De Brazza monkeys are leopards, eagles, pythons and humans.

  <h3>Reticulated Giraffes</h3>
  <img src="img/animalimgs/SpikeAndBakari.png" alt="mammals">
    <p>The reticulated giraffe is one of the nine subspecies of giraffe that live throughout Africa. Reticulated giraffes are usually found in Somalia but can also be found in neighboring parts of Kenya and Ethiopia. Giraffes in the wild usually live in small to medium sized groups of same sex members. The females usually form larger herds while they watch over the young and males roam in small bachelor groups. It is not unusual for giraffes to move between social groups and female groups will often have one or two males with them.</br>Giraffes are known for their great height and long necks. Giraffes are the largest land mammals on earth and can reach heights of over 18 feet tall, with their necks reaching sizes of up to 8 feet! They use those long necks to snag leaves, seeds, and fruit from the treetops of Africa which is their main source of food. Fortunately for the giraffe, no other animals match their massive height and they have very little competition for food. Despite having such large necks, Giraffes only have 7 large vertebrae in their neck – this is the same number as most other mammals, including humans!

  <h3>Red Kangaroo</h3>
  <img src="img/animalimgs/redkangaroo.jpg" alt="mammals">
    <p>The red kangaroo is the largest kangaroo in the world and comes from Australia. They usually stay in groups of 100 or more which are called “mobs”. Kangaroos can move 40 miles per hour and leap 40 or more feet in a single bound. Males are called “boomers” and sometimes referred to as a jack while females are called jill or referred to as “blue fliers”.</br>When a baby is born it is the size of your thumb nail and is hairless and blind. It crawls up the mother’s stomach until it reaches the pouch. It will stay in the pouch up to 9 months. Kangaroos have what is called delayed implantation which allows the females to hold a fertile egg dormant for several months until she is ready for another young. This is especially helpful because a female will want to have her young during the wet season.

    <p>Gemsbok are large antelope found in Africa. They usually weigh over 500 pounds and are about four feet tall at the shoulder. They have long, black horns that resemble a spear and are slightly spiraled. Gemsbok like to live in herds of 10 to 30 members, usually made up of females and young. Adult males generally live alone.</br>Gemsbok have adapted to dealing with the high temperatures of Africa. They eat dry desert grasses and can go for long periods without water. They can sometimes go all winter without drinking until the spring rains arrive. Gemsbok are very careful to stay out of the sunlight during the day to remain cool. They will try to stay under trees or shrubs, leaving the smallest part of their body exposed to the sun.

  <h3>Grant's Zebra</h3>
  <img src="img/animalimgs/zebra.jpg" alt="mammals">
    <p>Grant’s zebras are found in the plains areas of Africa. Herds of zebras are led by one male. Zebras will always travel as a herd and will never leave weak or young behind. Instead, the herd will slow their pace to accommodate the slower members.</br>Each zebra has a unique set of stripes and no two zebras are exactly the same. These unique stripes hold the zebra’s identity much like our fingerprints do. The zebra’s stripes also help to confuse predators such as hyenas, lions and African dogs.</br>When a baby is born, it will have brown stripes which will turn black once the baby is weaned from the mother.

  <h3>Marmoset</h3>
  <img src="img/animalimgs/marmoset.jpg" alt="mammals">
    <p>Marmosets are tiny primates that originally were found in South American rainforest canopies. More than a dozen marmoset species exist in the wild, with the common marmoset featured here at Lake Tobias Wildlife Park. A type of monkey, marmosets are 7-8 inches tall on average when mature and weigh 8-9 ounces. While infants are born with smooth brown and yellow coats, the mature animal has white ear tufts and a banded tail.</br>
      <h4>Diet of the Marmoset</h4></br>
      Like most primates, marmosets have a complex omnivorous diet based on the foods available in nature. Fruits and insects are dietary staples for much of the year. They will dine on flowers and fungi when available, as well as seeds and nectar. They receive valuable proteins from frogs, lizards, snails and other small prey.</br>The hands of the marmoset are less evolved than other monkeys, with sharp claws and no opposable thumb. However, the primate uses these sharp claws to feed on the trees in which they live naturally. Because the rainforest has little fruit the first four months of the year, the marmoset depends on tree exudates to compensate.</br>The gum, latex, resin and sap found in the trees contains rich nutrients to ensure their survival during these lean months. The marmoset is able to grip the trees tightly while chewing a small hole in the side. The resulting exudate is then licked up by the animal.
      <h4>A Day in the Life</h4></br>
      Marmosets are active social creatures who enjoy foraging during daylight hours. A group of them is known as a troop, comprising up to 15 animals in the wild. They are territorial when confronted with other groups, but playful when happy and safe.</br>In the wild, most marmoset couples appear to be monogamous. Younger ones will often not sexually mature until they are away from their family group. Some cases of polygamy and polyandry have been noted, though the reasons for these instances remains unclear.</br>The male plays an important role in the life of the offspring after the first two weeks. During that time, the infants stay on the mother’s back. However, once they begin wandering away from her, the father and younger members of the community begin to assume responsibilities in caring for the smallest members of the troop.</br>They communicate with each other through visual and vocal cues. Adults have scent glands on their anogenital and chest regions that can be used to mark territory and relay status.
    </br> Among primates, only the tamarin is smaller than these monkeys. Check out our marmosets and see why so many people take pleasure in these delightful little distant relative of the human species!

    <p>Alpaca come from the Andes Mountain in South America. Suri are one type of alpaca that have long hair which sometimes resembles dreadlocks. This hair can come in any color, usually black, white, brown or red.</br>Alpaca resemble small llamas and only weigh about 145 pounds. They are used for wool, meat and milk production. Alpacas always go to the bathroom in the same spot and prefer to give birth to young before noon when it is the coolest part of the day.

  <h3>Tamarin</h3>
  <img src="img/animalimgs/tamarin.jpg" alt="mammals">
    <p>When it comes to pint-sized creatures that are full of energy, nothing beats the New World monkey known as the tamarin. At Lake Tobias Wildlife Park, you can get a good look at these rambunctious pranksters as they delight in running wildly and swinging among the branches in their Reptiles & Exotics Facility exhibit. Currently, five Cotton top tamarins inhabit our man-made habitat that reflects their original environment and climate.</br>
      <h4>Tamarins in the Wild</h4></br>
    In the wild, tamarins were originally indigenous only to the Amazon Basin, but can now be found in jungles from southern Central America through central South America. The Cotton Top tamarin can be found only in Columbia and is considered to be endangered. Tamarins live in family groups of between three and nine members although they also will congregate in larger packs. They are omnivores – meaning that they will eat almost anything including the usual fruits and other plant parts as well as bird eggs, spiders and other insects and the occasional small vertebrate. Due to their small size, tamarins have a difficult life in the wild. Tamarins are considered prey by everything from birds of prey, snakes and other mammals.</br>
      <h4>Tamarins as Individuals</h4></br>
    On an individual level, tamarins look very similar to marmosets to the average viewer. In particular, they are quite small, usually less than one foot in body length — with a two-foot tail! — and generally weigh less than two pounds. Their coloring ranges from black to white and all the browns in between. A few species are also noted for their prominent facial hair. At Lake Tobias Wildlife Park, we give visitors a unique, close encounter with our tamarins. You will not be able to pet them but they are very inquisitive and will approach visitors as close as their habitat allows.

  <h3>Ostrich</h3>
  <img src="img/animalimgs/ostrich.jpg" alt="birds">
    <p>Ostriches are the world’s largest birds and are found in Africa. They can be nine feet tall and weigh 350 pounds. Because they are so big, ostriches cannot fly. Instead, they can run up to 45 miles per hour and have large powerful legs to provide a strong kick for protection. Ostriches like to live in groups of around 5 birds.</br>Ostriches like to eat leaves, flowers and seeds. They will also eat dirt, sand and stones to aid in digestion. Males are black with white tips on their wings, where as females are generally grey. An ostrich egg is the size of 20 chicken eggs.

  <img src="img/animalimgs/rhea.jpg" alt="birds">
    <p>Rheas are found in South America and are the world’s fourth largest bird. They are about five feet tall and weigh up to 75 pounds. Because they are so large, they cannot fly; however, they can run up to 40 miles per hour and use their large wings for sudden stops and turns. Rheas can be either light grey or white in color.</br>Male rheas will dig a nest in the ground where females will lay their eggs. Then the male will lay on these eggs for up to 40 days until they all hatch, and continue to raise the young by himself. What is interesting is that the young birds will make a whistling noise from inside the egg when they are ready to hatch. This is how they communicate to each other so they all hatch around the same day. The babies that are ready to hatch first will delay coming out of the egg until the others are ready. One rhea egg is the size of 12 chicken eggs.

    <p>East African crowned cranes are the largest of the African cranes. They have a wingspan of 6 ½ to 7 feet. And are the only African cranes that can sit in trees because of an elongated toe used to grasp the branches. Crowned cranes often are seen “dancing”, which includes head bobbing, jumping, tossing grass and sticks, flapping their wings and running around. This is thought to be part of a mating ritual. Crowned cranes will generally mate for life.</br>Crowned cranes live in both wetlands and grasslands. They will eat grass, seeds, small rodents, insects, small frogs and fish. They also make their nests in the wetlands. One nest will contain between two to five eggs.

    <p>American alligators come from the south eastern part of the United States, including Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana. They have a very broad head and rounded snout, where crocodiles will have a narrow head with a pointed snout. Alligators and crocodiles both have a blind spot right in front of their nose where they cannot see.</br>An alligator’s body is made mainly for the water, however, they can still move very quickly on land. In fact, they can run about 35 miles per hour but only for a short distance. Alligators can get up to 23 feet long and close their jaws at 2000 pounds of pressure per square inch.</br>Females will lay their eggs in a mound of rotting plants and mud and allow the sun and rotting vegetation to incubate the eggs. The heat in the nest will determine the sex of the baby alligators. If the eggs are kept at 89 degrees or lower, they will all hatch out as females. If they are kept at 91 degrees or higher, they will all hatch out as males. Any eggs kept at 90 degrees will be some male and some female.

They have been known to attack and eat humans in the wild.</br>Like all pythons, Burmese are able to locate their prey by using their labial pits, a small row of holes on their upper lip. These pits allow them to detect heat given off by their prey which tells the python how large and how far away their prey is.</br>Burmese pythons are typically brown with green and grey markings. Albino Burmese pythons are bright yellow and white and are very common in pet shops but not common in the wild. A Burmese python can have up to 500 pairs of ribs.

  <h3>Green Tree Python</h3>
  <img src="img/animalimgs/greentreepython.jpg" alt="reptamph">
    <p>The green tree python is found in Australia and New Guinea and is an endangered species. They live in the treetops of tropical, humid forests and coil up on the branches to wait for small rodents or birds to come by. They can locate prey by using their labial pits, a small row of holes on their upper lip. These pits allow them to detect the heat given off by their prey, which tells the python how big the animal is and how far away it is.</br>Young tree pythons are bright yellow, orange or red until they change to a bright green like the adults. The adults have white and/or blue markings on their back and can grow between three to five feet long.
